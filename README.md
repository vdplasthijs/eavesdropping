# Code for Van der Plas, Vogels* and Manohar*, 2022, Proceedings Machine Learning Research (accepted). 
Presented at COLLAS, August 2022, conference. 

See paper for explanation, this is the code that created all figures, including the saved trained networks.

- All packages are stated in `py37.yml` (use anaconda to create a new environment from this file)
- `Train or load a single network.ipynb` is an example notebook of how to train RNNs on 1 or multiple tasks.
- `Figure generation notebook.ipynb` creates all figures of the paper

Please note: because all networks are saved, the repository is quite large (approximately 750MB). Alternatively, you can download everything except the `models/` folder (and the `.git/` folder) to exclude pre-trained networks, which saves 740MB.
